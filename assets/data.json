In Canada, I lived with my friends, so sometimes we found it frustrating when we needed to record our expenses, such as rent and groceries, and calculate the amounts owed. Therefore, I designed this web app to handle all this for us. Using the MERN stack, I was able to develop this PWA efficiently. The PWA's nature allows it to be installed both on desktops and phone devices, which makes it even more convenient to use in daily life.",

The idea for this API came from video game character creators. Before building the API, I used Procreate to draw various facial expressions, hairstyles, expressions, and accessories options for the avatars and generated avatar images with all the combinations with Python scripts. The API was then built with Next.js, a react framework that enables server-side rendering. Next.js also supports API routing, so I could write both front-end and back-end code within the same code base. On the website, users can choose between light and dark modes based on their preferences. They can also find documentation to learn how to use the API endpoints, and the avatar maker to preview avatars with all the available options.",

The goal of building this website was to learn PHP with the Laravel framework for back-end development, and Vue.js for front-end development. With Laravel, I gained a deeper understanding of the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. The built-in support that Laravel offers, such as routing, sessions, and user authentication, also helped me create the website very quickly. Like React, Vue.js allows me to build an interactive front-end with a component-based architecture. Inertia.js serves as a bridge between Laravel and Vue.js without requiring APIs. It also supports server-side rendering (SSR), which allows SEO optimization for the website. On the website, customers can register, login, and manage their accounts. They can add items to their cart, checkout, and view their orders anytime.",

My teammates and I understand these concerns of students and designed this app to help connecting students from the same school.
